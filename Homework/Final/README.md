# Midterm
http://mahindrapersaud.me/

## Concept/Theme

* Simple organized resume site
* Allows viewers to be able to interact with the site

## Will Be Added Later
* Will second as a blog about projects and research I am doing
* Will add php for actually allowing users to submit/emial me.
* Will add some more movement around the site
* Add carousel of pictures of my hobbies and adventures

## Change in idea
* Planned to use multiple pages and links for the midterm but I decided against it.
* Found old website I was working on to make my resume and decided to fix it up and use it.
* Turned from 3/4 pages into one single page

### Issues Encountered
* Creating the smooth scrolling was a pain. It wasn't until I looked up a tutorial that I was able to see how to do it with javascript and so forth
* Since this was old code, I had to spend a lot of time going through and throwing out things I didn't need and relearning my code all over again.
* Spent a hell of a time just going through and recommenting parts of the code for better organizations.
* Wanted to use the OWL Carousel API but figured since we can't use it I would need to just lay it out. So that was like 4 hours scrapped.
* The Stats page I found on a site and found it interesting looking. It was a pain to understand how it worked until I realized what I needed to do to get it done. It's funny how Javascript just works itself into your code that you thought would end up being purely CSS huh?

### Concepts Needed
* Decide how I want interaction with users
* Figure out how to create fluid movement throughout the site
 * I don't want it to be flat and stationary. Instead I want to see if I can add some animations
* How to add a carousel of pictures he way I want

### Plans for the future

* Project portfolio
 * Each project image will link to the project if hostable with information with the project.
* Slideshow pictures wwill be on the side and when spinning through them. They'll make a larger image above them display the current picture in the "dock"
* Create a game that lets the user learn about me as they play. Will be done much much later and provide user with the option “Do you wanna play a game?”
