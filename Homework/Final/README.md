## Concept/Theme

* Simple organized resume site
* Allows viewers to be able to interact with the site

## Will Be Added Later
* Will second as a blog about projects and research I am doing
* Will add some more movement around the site

### Issues Encountered
* Was having issues with magnificint popup, this is an external api/plugin which would make it have some much better looking modals. had to remove the magnificient api and  use bootstrap's own modal.
* Had an issue with the owl carousel. It took a bit but I figured out the problem was that I was calling my JS file before I imported their JS file. Order of importing is important kids.

### Concepts Needed
* Figure out how to create fluid movement throughout the site
 * I don't want it to be flat and stationary. Instead I want to see if I can add some animations
* How to add a carousel of pictures the way I want
* How to get the modals to work and look nice at the same time.

### Plans for the future

* Project portfolio
 * Each project image will link to the project if hostable with information with the project.
* Slideshow pictures wwill be on the side and when spinning through them. They'll make a larger image above them display the current picture in the "dock"
* Create a game that lets the user learn about me as they play. Will be done much much later and provide user with the option “Do you wanna play a game?”
