## Motivation

Originally I wanted to create a simple site that you could use to ensure you have all the materials and everything else needed in one window. I decided to keep the site simple, including an embedded window that'll allow the user to follow a video if they can't read the directions all the time.

Since the requirements included a side column for the page, I decided to slip the page into 2 columns. The Left column would consist of the video and the first half of the ingredients needed. The right column would include the directions and the second half of the ingredients that would be needed

I wanted to keep the website really simplistic but honestly, I know i could do so much better if I spent more time wiith it. I spent so much time trying to fix the iframe that I wasn't able to create a website that I knew I could make. It looks aethetically pleasing but it could be better. I think if I was able to spend more time on it I could have created i as a longer page and make it a bit better. I was honestly looking at the page this morning and wanted to throw it away and started from scratch.

In regards to how close to my original wireframe, the site fits. However, it's slightly altered. I was planning on adding in a light music to the background while the user browses but I was unable to determine how to do that. The final product I have is mediocre at its best and it really can be done better. I plan on spending a lot more time on the midterm to ensure that the product I want comes to fruition.
