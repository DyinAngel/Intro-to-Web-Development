	Wireframing a website is something that has not been in my mind much as a programmer. I didn't create my own personal website with wireframing first. I actually did what the article said not to and jumped right in. I started trying to create various looks here and there and I honestly spent more time just experimenting to find a good look than rather actually being able to get the site up going. The article says that you should sketch out as much of your website as you can. I honestly, never spend time doing that. I never really sketch until later on down the line when I have a site full of random divs and paragraphs trying to formulate themselves into something. It makes me realize that I really need to start to stop and think first before i really start to just code. If I had just took the time to wireframe the website before hand I wouldn't have wasted so much time trying to figure out what i should do next. The article also calls for Feedback. I never got feedback on my site from anyone. When the site was live and ready then I got feedback and would go back and change things and improve upon it with the suggestions of others.
