### Concepts Covered

* Basic CSS
* Standard HTML
 * Navigation
 * Anchor tags for varying pages
 * Shadows
 * Boxes
 * Sidebars

### Concepts Needed

* How to add audio/playlist to site
* Slideshow Carousel
* Decide how I want some animation
* Figure out how to create fluid movement throughout the site
 * I don't want it to be flat and stationary. Instead I want to see if I can add some animations
* Fix Contact Form

### Plans for the future

* Each project in Language will link to the project
* Create a game that lets the user learn about me as they play. Will be done much much later and provide user with the option “Do you wanna play a game?”
